Machine Learning Cycle:
1. **Configuration of the System** : Iterative, Notebook, code structure, data, where will it reside, folders, cloud buckets etc. **Team**

2. **Data Collection** : initial Data Set   **Team**

3. **Set Data Narrative** : Set Business Objectives, what use case are you solving for  **Team**

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization:**
* feature analysis and engineering (for ML, for DL it's feature extraction) **Amrutha**
